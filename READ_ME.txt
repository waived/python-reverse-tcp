PYTHON SHELL:

Description:
      Reverse TCP connection. The 'server.py' controller can manage
      multiple incoming-connections from devices infected with 'client.py'

      Generally build with the intent of being used with Linux/Unix
      environments, this script can easily be used on Windows NT
      platforms as well.

Note: There are no features/functions built into this shell. It only
      functions as a raw terminal environment, using SH, BASH, of CMD
      statements. If said statements yield verbose outputs to the user,
      the client.py backdoor will report the output to the attacker.

      This shell cannot manage sessions with devices in a concurrent
      fashion, nor switch between sessions. This is a basic shell design
      used for basic penetration testing / red teaming activities.

Use responsibly!
